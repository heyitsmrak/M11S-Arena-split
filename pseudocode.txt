mechanic order:
    -conga on each side
    -4 tethers go out, each on a random player
        >a player may have to swap sides to stretch their tether, or stay on the same side
        >afterwards, they'll have to determine to go north or south
    -4 non-tethered players
        >with no-buddies strategy, they will always stay on their platform.
